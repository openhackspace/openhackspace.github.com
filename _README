Site generated with Jekyll.

Briefly, Jekyll is run on the server, and transforms all contents in this folder,
except file starting with '_' and places it in _site. Note that _site is not
pushed, only the sources are.

To test locally, do

    make start

then view the pages on http://localhost:4000/.
