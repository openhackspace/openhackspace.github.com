Hans HÃ¶glund: Algorithmic composition in Haskell

A workshop providing an introduction to functional programming language and algorithmic composition. I will show basics of Haskell programming along with examples of algorithmic composition from my own work.

* Music representation: phrasing, articulation, part structure
* Lazy data structures: infinite melodies, rhythms and other sequences etc
* Time manipulation: stretching, compressing, cutting, reversing
* Pitch manipulation: transposition, inversion, modal alterations
* Filtering and folding: removing notes, transforming selected notes etc

We will use the Haskell Music suite (a set of Haskell libraries written by me) to generate MIDI, OSC and MusicXML.
